# Overview

Subliminal-Zest is a theme plugin inspired by the likes of the pastel-colored,
dark colors in the Zeonica theme in VS Code and the strategic, syntactical
rules of Subliminal-Next. This theme aims to draw your attention to only the key
elements of your code - function definitions, variable, function calls, class
names, numbers, etc. while leaving keywords remain subtly camouflaged in the
background.
